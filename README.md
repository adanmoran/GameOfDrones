============

The P2 Project for APSC 200, Section 203-03.

This project defines an algorithm that calculates an optimized path between two graph nodes using only LOCAL information. That is, it is different from algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm in the sense that it does not have full view of the graph, and cannot run multiple possible paths before deciding.

The algorithm is being used to optimize package delivery paths. It is being tested using the 10 largest cities in California by population, and will run in Matlab.
